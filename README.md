Code49 Decoder **(For [Arknights](https://ak.hypergryph.com/) PV4 puzzle ONLY)**

Thanks to [lukecyca](https://github.com/lukecyca)'s [code49 encoder](https://github.com/lukecyca/code49)

**It treats Code49 as Mode-0, and ignores other non-data characters.**

## About

Decoder is written as a simple inverse program of [code49 encoder](https://github.com/lukecyca/code49).

**Note:** [Code49 encoder](https://github.com/lukecyca/code49) is in Python2, our decoder is in Python3, so some of the original codes are rewritten into Python3.
